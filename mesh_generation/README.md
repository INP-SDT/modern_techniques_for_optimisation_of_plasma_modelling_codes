# ML-based optimisation of mesh generation

This project task deals with generating mesh based on available photographs of the discharge, or discharge arrangement technical drawings and schematic diagrams. The task is achieved using two approaches:
- Generating mesh using Python-based *nanomesh* library
- Shape recognition via *Open CV2* and mesh generation using *gmsh* implemented in tool *photosmesher*.
