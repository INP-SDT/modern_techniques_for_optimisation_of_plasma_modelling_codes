# Tailoring preconditioners for better iterative linear solver performance

**Development of preconditioners for iterative linear solvers**\
  The set of nonlinear (often stiff) partial differential equations (PDEs) used in plasma models results in a set of nonlinear equations after temporal and spatial discretisation. These equations are solved using a Newton-based methods, which involves solving a linear system of equations during each Newton iteration. To shorten the solution time and reduce memory usage, a linear system of equations can be solved using an iterative linear solver instead of a direct one. The iterative solvers have a high potential for parallelisation, allowing significant speed-up of the solution process on computing clusters. However, iterative solvers require a proper choice of preconditioners, which has a substantial impact on their performance. The goal is to design a preconditioner based on approximate inverse of the original matrix and test the performance gain.
